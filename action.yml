      List of packages to be excluded from testing.

      For multiple packages, separate using spaces or use multiline syntax:

      ```yml
      ignore: package1 package2
      # or
      ignore: >-
        package1
        package2
      ```
    required: false
  whitelist:
    description: |
      Whitelist of packages to be included in testing.
      When specified, `ignore` is not used.
      The resulting set of packages to be tested is an overlap between those
      in the dependency tree and those defined in `whitelist`. If you want to
      define additional packages, use `additional`.

      For multiple packages, separate using spaces or use multiline syntax:

      ```yml
      whitelist: package1 package2
      # or
      whitelist: >-
        package1
        package2
      ```
    required: false
  include:
    description: |
      A list of additional packages not in the dependency tree to be tested.
      This is useful to test known downstream packages that have your package as
      an optional dependency hence will not show up in the dependency tree.

      For multiple packages, separate using spaces or use multiline syntax:

      ```yml
      include: package1 package2
      # or
      include: >-
        package1
        package2
      ```
    required: false
  env:

      Conda environment file to setup development environment allowing to build the package.
    required: false
  install:
    description: |
      Additional packages to be installed to the environment.
      These are not tested unless they are in the dependency tree anyway.
      You can pass a comma-separated list (e.g. "numpy,pandas,xarray").
